# CSES Companion: Project Summary

## Current Status
**Project Enhanced**

The CSES Companion Chrome extension has been successfully developed, debugged, and enhanced with new UI positioning and theme detection capabilities. All core features are fully functional, providing a seamless and enhanced coding experience on the CSES platform. The project is now considered complete and ready for packaging and distribution.

## Project Overview
This project aimed to build a Chrome extension for the CSES (Code Submission Evaluation System) website to enhance the user experience by integrating a code editor and automating the submission process.

## Core Features

*   **In-Website Code Editor**: A full-featured Monaco editor is injected directly into the CSES problem pages.
*   **Automatic Code Submission**: Submit your code with a single click, without having to manually create and upload a file.
*   **Local Test Case Runner**: Run your code against the sample test cases directly in the browser using the Judge0 API.
*   **Template Management**: Save and manage your code templates for different languages.
*   **Persistent Preferences**: The extension remembers your preferred language, font size, and code for each problem.
*   **Auto-saving Code**: Your code is automatically saved locally as you type.

## Recent Enhancements

### UI Positioning Changes
The UI elements have been repositioned to appear after the problem description in the following order:
1. Toolbar (`cf-lite-toolbar`)
2. Editor (`cses-editor-container`) - with 0px top margin and 20px bottom margin
3. Sample cases (`sample-case`)
4. Output container (`cses-companion-output-container`)

Previously, the toolbar was positioned at the top of the content area, but it's now placed directly after the problem description for a more logical user flow.

### Theme Detection Improvements
Enhanced theme detection system to dynamically adapt to changes when users toggle the theme on the CSES website:
- Expanded MutationObserver to monitor changes to class, style, and data-theme attributes on both body and documentElement
- Added fallback mechanism with periodic style checks (every second) to detect theme changes that might not trigger DOM mutations
- Implemented more responsive theme updates to ensure the editor theme matches the website theme in real-time

## Debugging Journey: Fixing the Submission Button

A significant part of this project involved debugging the "Submit" button, which went through several iterations of fixes.

### Problem 1: Incorrect Language Value

*   **Symptom**: The submission would fail on the final submission page.
*   **Diagnosis**: The language value being sent to the submission form (`cpp`, `java`, `python`) did not match the values expected by the CSES website (`C++`, `Java`, `Python 3`).
*   **Solution**: A mapping was added in `content/submission.js` to convert the internal language codes to the correct format required by the CSES submission form.

### Problem 2: Unresponsive Submit Button

*   **Symptom**: The "Submit" button on the problem page did nothing when clicked.
*   **Diagnosis**: The `initializer.js` script, which runs in the page's context, was not listening for the specific `cses-companion-get-code-for-submit` message sent by the content script when the button was clicked.
*   **Solution**: An event listener case was added to `initializer.js` to handle this message, retrieve the code from the editor, and send it back to the content script to initiate the submission process.

### Problem 3: Submission Form Not Found

*   **Symptom**: After fixing the unresponsive button, the submission process would fail on the submission page with the error `CSES Companion: Submission form not found.`
*   **Diagnosis**: The selector used to find the submission form (`form[action*="/submit"]`) was no longer valid, likely due to a change in the CSES website's HTML.
*   **Solution**: The logic was updated in `content/submission.js` to first find the language selector (`select[name="language"]`) and then get its parent form. This proved to be a more robust method.

### Problem 4: Language Select Not Found

*   **Symptom**: The fix for Problem 3 failed with the error `CSES Companion: Language select not found.`
*   **Diagnosis**: The selector for the language dropdown (`select[name="language"]`) was also incorrect.
*   **Solution**: After further investigation (and some educated guessing based on common web development practices), the selector was changed to `select[name="lang"]` in `content/submission.js`. This was the final fix that made the entire submission flow work correctly.

## Final Technical Architecture

The final architecture consists of a content script (`content.js`) that injects the editor and handles user interactions on the problem page, a submission script (`submission.js`) that handles the form submission on the submission page, and an initializer script (`initializer.js`) that manages the Monaco editor in the page's context. Communication between these scripts is handled via `window.postMessage` and `chrome.storage`.

## Completion Summary

This project is now complete. The CSES Companion extension has been developed with all the core features implemented as per the plan. The extension is now ready for packaging and distribution. The debugging process was crucial in making the extension robust and resilient to changes on the target website.

**Final Features:**
- In-Website Code Editor
- Automatic Code Submission
- Local Test Case Runner
- Template Management
- Language and Font Size Preferences
- Auto-saving Code
- Enhanced UI positioning after problem description
- Dynamic theme detection and adaptation

**Next Steps:**
- Package the extension for the Chrome Web Store.
- Write a comprehensive user guide.
- Promote the extension to the competitive programming community.
